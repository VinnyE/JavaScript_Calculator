A JavaScript calculator completed for the advanced projects portion of the Free Code Camp curriculum.

User stories fulfilled:

1) User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
2) User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
3) User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

**** If you're browsing via mobile, you may likely encounter some issues with buttons being reordered due to some flexbox quirks. Seems like the flex basis rule is not being respected on mobile at the moment. For best viewing, I recommend using the latest version of your desktop browser.
